MeshPainter - Paint Directly on Meshes
Blenderizer - Object Focused Editor Camera
Metaballs - Create New Organic Base Meshes

Mesh Cutter - Cut, Copy & Paste Parts of Meshes
Prefab Maker - Combine, Atlas & Prefab creation


Notes
----------------------------------------
The Mesh Maker menu is located in the Window section on the Unity menu bar.

The main menu now pops up on the scene view window and hides itself in the bottom left corner when not in use. To show the menu simply place the mouse over the visible title.

You can open up all of the programs at the same time and use them in combination, though this has not been thoroughly tested in all cases. If you have any problems try restarting Mesh Maker or Unity to see if that fixes the problem.
  
Geom:
Duplicates of grids made in the hierarchy will not be automatically added to Geom.
Don't delete the Framework or the Grids from the hierarchy, use Geom to delete grids or use the Exit button to end the build session.
Renaming the Grids in the hierarchy will not change their names within Geom.

Mesh Editor:
All of the functions work on skinned meshes except for triangle and edge extrusion.
To work on different sized models you can now change the epsilon value by going into the setting and changing the epsilon value.
When extruding multiple triangles that meet at a single point they sometimes have inverted faces. The solution is to extrude the triangles individually.

Metaballs:
This is an early version of the program and is suitable for working with up to a dozen or so quality metaballs but more if you work in a lower resolution. Ideal for creating a base mesh that can be tweaked with the Mesh Editor program.

Boolean Ops:
It is not recommended to do more that a few operations on the same target object or the geometry may become corrupt. While the program works well on simple objects it may fail on very complicated objects or objects with underlying problems like holes in their geometry. It is highly recommended that you make a copy of the target object and save your scene before using this software.

3D Brush:
In Unity 5 it is recommended to turn of continuous baking of lightmaps by going to the menu and navigating to Window/Lighting/Lightmaps and unchecking the checkbox. This will prevent lag in the editor.

Mesh Editor uses a cut down version of the undo/redo framework written by Nims72. Very nice code and highly recommended. (https://github.com/Nims72/Unity-Custom-Undo-Redo-System)

The textures used in the videos were made By Dexsoft Games and are available for free on the Asset Store. (http://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/1809)

The resources feature of Prefab Maker is kindly provided by Simon Oliver to the public domain. (https://github.com/handcircus/Unity-Resource-Checker)

The example assets used with 3D Brush are available for free from Unity Technologies at the following locations:

Standard Terrain Assets
Available in Unity by clicking on the Assets menu item and going to Import Package/Terrain Assets.

The city model used in the screenshots and videos for Mesh Cutter is called Japanese Otaku City and was created by ZENRIN CO. LTD. I would like to thank the creators of this great asset which is available for free on the asset store at  https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/20359
